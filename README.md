The goal of this project is to make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
Warning : the calculator does not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time.

## Skills to practice

This is one of my first project, still getting familiar with HTML, CSS and JS. Achieving clean code takes time, and learning other completly new skills at te same time is not easy, my focus here was on : 

- DOM manipulations in JS
- Getting more familiar with CSS
- Working with Flexbox
- Working with Developer Tools

  
## Features

The calculator should do the following :
- an operate function takes an operator and 2 numbers and then calls one of the following functions on the numbers :
  - add
  - subtract
  - multiply
  - divide
- dynamic and retro UI

## Improvements

- Add keyboard support
- Evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time (add functions to treat division / multiplications first)
- Clean code by breaking functions into even smaller and pure functions if possible and regroup related variables / functions into classes or objects
